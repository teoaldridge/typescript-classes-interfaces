# typescript-classes-interfaces
An exercise, in which I learned about classes and interfaces in TypeScript.

I did this exercise as part of my studies with 'Understanding Typescript' by Maximillian Schwarzmuller:
https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/

In this exercise, I learned and practiced: 
- Understanding Classes
- Constructor functions and the 'this' keyword
- 'Private' and 'Public' Access Modifiers
- Shorthand Initialization
- 'readonly' Properties
- Inheritance
- Overriding Properties and the 'protected' Modifier
- Getters and Setters
- Static Methods and Properties
- Abstract Classes
- Singletons and Private Contructors
- Understanding Interfaces
- Using Interfaces with Classes
- Readonly Interface Properties
- Optional Parameters and Properties

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
